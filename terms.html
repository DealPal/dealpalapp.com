        <div class="section-title">18. ARBITRATION & DISPUTE RESOLUTION</div>
        
        <div class="subsection-title">18.1 – AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</div>
        <div class="paragraph">All disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App (including but not limited to claims regarding user content, pricing accuracy, store information, personal injury, property damage, or statutory claims) shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the ADR Institute of Canada, rather than through court litigation.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.2 – WAIVER OF COURT TRIAL</div>
        <div class="paragraph">You and Deal Pal each waive the right to have any dispute resolved in court by a judge or jury, except as otherwise provided in Section 18.9 below.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.3 – CLASS ACTION WAIVER</div>
        <div class="paragraph">You and Deal Pal each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. You waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision shall be null and void (but all other provisions of these Terms remain in effect).</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.4 – ARBITRATION PROCEDURES</div>
        <div class="paragraph">The arbitration will be conducted in Ontario, Canada, under the rules of the ADR Institute of Canada. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, unless the arbitrator determines that a party's claim or defense was frivolous or brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award costs and fees to the prevailing party.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.5 – EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION</div>
        <div class="paragraph">Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek equitable relief (such as injunctive relief or specific performance) in court to protect intellectual property rights or confidential information.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.6 – ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL COSTS</div>
        <div class="paragraph">If you attempt to bring any dispute in court rather than through arbitration (except as permitted in Section 18.5), and Deal Pal successfully compels arbitration, Deal Pal may seek to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in enforcing this arbitration provision.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.7 – OPT-OUT RIGHT</div>
        <div class="paragraph">You have the right to opt out of this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of first using the App. To opt out, you must send written notice to info@dealpalapp.com stating your name, email address, and intent to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, you retain the right to resolve disputes in court, but the class action waiver in Section 18.3 will still apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.8 – SURVIVAL</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and your use of the App.</div>

        <div class="subsection-title">18.9 – JURISDICTIONAL LIMITATIONS</div>
        <div class="paragraph">Some US states, Canadian provinces, and other jurisdictions restrict or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements or class action waivers, particularly for certain consumer claims.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">If you are a resident of a jurisdiction where any provision of this Section 18 is found to be unenforceable or prohibited by law, then:</div>
        <div class="bullet-point">• The unenforceable provision will not apply to you</div>
        <div class="bullet-point">• You may retain the right to pursue claims in court</div>
        <div class="bullet-point">• You may retain the right to participate in class action lawsuits</div>
        <div class="bullet-point">• All other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This Section 18 will be interpreted to the maximum extent enforceable under the laws of your jurisdiction.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">Jurisdictions with known restrictions include (but are not limited to): California (certain consumer claims), Washington State, New Jersey, and various others. This list is not exhaustive, and you should consult local legal counsel regarding your specific rights.</div>
